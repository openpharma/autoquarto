\section{Usage Notes}{

The locations that are searched to locate \code{file} at the time the \code{QuartoCompoundObject}
is \code{publish}ed depend on the way in which \code{file} is defined.  If \code{file} is a path,
whether relative or absolute, then only that location is searched.  If the file
is specified using only a base name, then the elements of \code{templateSearchPath}
are searched, in order, to locate a file with that base name.  Only the first
match is returned.
